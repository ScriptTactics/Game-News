# Game-News
This Discord Bot will subscribe to any steam news feed that you want updates and information on using the SteamWebAPI


## Installation

1. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer **OR** download the [ZIP](https://github.com/PWRxPSYCHO/Game-News/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) of the project.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP **OR** navigate inside the cloned repository.
3. Once inside the folder create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. The file will need the following:
```.env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
CHID=
CLIENTID=
GUILDID=
```

You will need to create a Bot on discord and get the Token to place in this file. You will also need the Channel ID of the channel you want the bot to post to, you will need the Bot's client ID and the Guild ID (Server Id).

Once you have all of these you will have to add the bot to your server.

## Adding Bot to Server

This is the URL you will use to add the bot to your server. You will have to change 2 things in this url.

1. `client_id=` - set this to your BOT's Client ID
2. `permissions=` - this will have to be set to to correct numeric value to allow your bot to send messages, create slash commands, and read messages.

Use [this](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) tool to help you create the permission integer.

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123456789012345678&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands
`


## Running the Bot

Once you added the bot to your server and you setup the appropriate tokens and ID's in your `.env` file you are ready to run the bot.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed: `Version: 16.13.0LTS`

 This should also install NPM as the package manager so you can install all the other dependencies.

 After NodeJS and NPM is installed, open a terminal in the root directory of the project and type:

 ```
 npm install
 ```
 once that finishes you can proceed to run the bot by typing:

 ```
 npm run start
 ```

 If this works you should see your bot come online in your discord server.


you may also need to create 2 .json files in the project root directory
1. `subscriptionList.json`
2. `messageHistory.json`
